# Carbon Intensity Calculations (parse.py)

## Purpose

- parse the control file

### Inputs

- control file
- key parameters

### Exports

- functions and variables representing the parsed control file

### Code Pipeline

- things are inputted
- they're separated using a read yaml function
- they are assigned certain values
- they're used later on all over

## Structure

### Functions

### Dataclasses

- control file dataclass
- all of the rlevant data necessary is in this class

## Constraints

- very strict parsing
- doesn't raise enough errors

### Areas for Improvement

- defensive code?

### Edge Cases
